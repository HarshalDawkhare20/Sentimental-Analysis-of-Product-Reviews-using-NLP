0,Apple iPhone 12 (128GB) - White,5,"This was my first switch to an ios device after using an android untill now. And I am not disappointed. The build quality, the responsive touch, the display, the camera, the battery life are just exceptional.Been using for about 10 days now, and consistently giving around 7h of screen on time.The camera is just way too good. Espeecially the night mode impressed me a lot.Only issue when switching from Android to iPhone I encountered was to be not able to restore my whatsapp chats. There are no official/free ways for doing this.The phone is simple amazing."
1,Apple iPhone 12 (128GB) - White,1,The media could not be loaded.                 ¬†Bad experience! I have purchased Iphone from Amazon before as well but this time the activation of new iphone 12 failed when I was setting it up. I tried contacting Apple support but the serial number mentioned on the box was invalid. I really don't know if it is a counterfeit product or there is some technical issue but one thing is sure that Apple's Website is not recognising the IMEI and serial Number of new Iphone 12 I bought from here
2,Apple iPhone 12 (128GB) - White,4,"I am writing this review after 40 days of use of iPhone 12. phone camera is excellent like DSLR ,very fast processor ,face ID feature looks great ,overall everything is fine but only issue which this phone has is , battery draining too fast. You can use 100% battery only for 5-6 hours of continuous use after that you have to charge it. Apple should look into this."
3,Apple iPhone 12 (128GB) - White,5,Same like the old classic iphone 5 lookBut now difference is only6.1 inch display or The A 14 bionic chipAnd oled Hd display
4,Apple iPhone 12 (128GB) - White,1,"Device is wonderful but never buy expensive items from Amazon, its better to purchase from Apple store.Delayed delivery by 3 days and on top of it no one in amazon knows where my device was. I have to perform multiple follow ups to enquire about my device and Amazon CSR is worst when it comes to logging a complaint.The final product received is having a dent and Amazon denied servicing and asked to check with Apple, Apple of-course denied since the product is purchased from third party e-commerce website.Lesson learned after 5 days of total frustration and being played as shuttlecock between Amazon and Apple, its better to spend few bucks more and purchase iPhone from Apple rather than typing this review with a dented device."
5,Apple iPhone 12 (128GB) - White,5,"The media could not be loaded.                 ¬†I was litterly worried before getting it delivered, as my delivery was late, I thought they will be some golmal on product, but I got the original product which I was expecting.. pls go n buy, don't get panic by seeing reviews.. I'm very excited with my new phone.. battery life is also good. Face is awesomepart and camera quality at picks... best deal for this independence day üòçü§©"
6,Apple iPhone 12 (128GB) - White,5,"Its my First Apple device. Happy to own it after a long confusion between iPhone 11 and 12. I believe, it was worth waiting for 12.Received it on 04-Nov-2020. Working well till now. Checked Service Support Coverage. Its a genuine product.AndiPhone in white color is legend.Update after 1 month approx.-----------------------------------After using it for a month I am in love with this phone. Too smooth and I forgot what is lagging...Battery backup is very good and lasts one and half day easily with normal usage. I charge my phone when the battery is around 30%. Battery health is 100% after a month.Camera is awesome and gives very nicely detailed pictures with true colors.Phone speakers are really great and warm. They are loud but don't shout. Listening music or watching videos are enjoyable without earphones too.4G speed better than other 4g phones I have.Worth every penny."
7,Apple iPhone 12 (128GB) - White,1,"Bought an iPhone 12 during ongoing freedom sale and I received a defective piece as the phone has tiny dents around the charging port. I tried returning it but there‚Äôs no option to replace or return.  Don‚Äôt know what to do, stuck with it after spending 62 K."
8,Apple iPhone 12 (128GB) - White,5,"Amazing iPhone, worthy updatehave to buy a type-c supported charging adaptor for charginggood displaydecent battery lifenice night clicksoverall worthy upgrade from classic iPhonebuy apple original 20w adaptor for charging, it fill battery faster than any other adaptor"
9,Apple iPhone 12 (128GB) - White,5,"Upgraded for iPhone XR. Battery lasts almost the same as XR but iPhone adapts as per usage over time so it will take time. Which anyways it lasts me for around 1.5 day with normal use and data services and location services always on. Do check the YouTube video to make necessary changes in settings for battery optimisation. Nothing beats the camera performance and let alone the video performance. Phone factor (rectangular edges) feels good to hold however even the MagSafe back cover when put on ruins the fun. Instead try buying a thin screen guard for back of the phone and tempered glass for the front glass as both front and back of the phone seem to be delicate and a costly affair when planning repairs. Overall the performance is great. The backup for Mini is pathetic, buy only if you have very minimal use of the phone. If a telephoto photography doesn‚Äôt seem to be on your agenda then this is a smart choice over the pro model."
10,Apple iPhone 12 (128GB) - White,5,Great battery life. Love the white colour. Blue is super hyped. It is a finger print magnet.There‚Äôs something about the design of these phones. No android phone can match the aesthetics. Except some curved display screens.Upgraded from iPhone 8. I am very very happy.Wish it was a bit cheaper. Bought with 6k instant hdfc discount and 6 months no cost emi.128gb.

12,Apple iPhone 12 (128GB) - White,1,Overall mobile is good but found blue spots on side and upper frame. This is not expected from Amazon. This is my worst order experience with Amazon. Really disappointing!
13,Apple iPhone 12 (128GB) - White,1,"The media could not be loaded.                 ¬†I got this iphone 12 defected peace from amazone , so i contact to amazone support but they refuse to replace the item and suggested me to go in apple service centre to repair this issue .So finally i went to the service centre and they helped me and take my phone for 7-8 days for screen replacement, but at the end i got my phone with replaced screen and now its working fine.Note - the product service centre service is good , but sorry i can‚Äôt say the same for amazon support ."
14,Apple iPhone 12 (128GB) - White,1,The media could not be loaded.                 ¬†Was out of country and have opened this iPhone which I have ordered in Jan yesterday only and have found that it was damaged from screen .How can I get a product replacement as return window has also got closed and have got a defected product .Pls help
15,Apple iPhone 12 (128GB) - White,5,"Its outstanding. I was using iphone 12 mini. Size wise this is better. This is amazing machine. Camera is great, performance is amazing, display is outstanding. Using iPhone 12 is some thing I never experienced before. This is fantastic device.RatingsSpeed - 5/5Display - 5/5Battery - 5/5Weight - 5/5Camera - 4.5/5You need a proper light for great photo. In low light sometime photo is quite dark but original.If you are new to apple eco system then you are going to experience something great. If you have already used apple devices then it will not disappoint you."
16,Apple iPhone 12 (128GB) - White,5,"Now it's almost more than 2 weeks of usage and I'm fully satisfied with the performance. Earlier I was using oneplus 6T and after malfunction of the screen, i decided to move to Iphone. Before buying i had done all the R&D. Many of reviews says that it has bad battery life and couldn't stand a day. But as per my usages my battery stays all day long. I used to make call (6 to 7 hours), video, music, surfing everything except game and battery last upto 24 hours with data mode on.In my opinion its worth buying."
17,Apple iPhone 12 (128GB) - White,5,Battery performance is disgusting. Camera is 4/5. Gaming amazing. Heat up so much. Everytime heating problem comes out. While charging or gaming....heat up so much.
18,Apple iPhone 12 (128GB) - White,5,"This is my first iPhone purchase , coming from oneplus 7 I don't have any regrets about the switch. Yes the switch was painful (especially because I lost all my whatsapp chats) but is worth it. comparing to oneplus 7, this phone has all features from it but in better form. My OP7 was smooth, fast had good battery camera,battery and  haptics. iPhone is just way smoother,fast and have great camera,battery and haptics. There is a slight learning curve. took 2 days to get used to gestures and navigations but is smooth sailing. the only negative feedback would be no charger in the box. You will have to get from apple.com if you want fast 20W one."
19,Apple iPhone 12 (128GB) - White,5,"Upgraded from an iPhone 7 32 gigs to iPhone 12 . After holding out for a long time the upgrade was worth it. All the feature set display, camera, speakers, signal reception, chipset is a huge upgrade. Recommended if you happen to have a device from 2016 or older. This device will be the new standard iPhone for the next 4 years. So worth it if you get it now."
20,Apple iPhone 12 (128GB) - White,1,The media could not be loaded.                 ¬†If you are planning to buy an iphone then please buy from stores only.I got a defective product and when I complain about it to amazon customer care and requested for replacement they simply deny to replace it.Don't waste your money.
21,Apple iPhone 12 (128GB) - White,5,"Since launch I am using iphone, previously I buy from show room, but now I living at a place there is no iPhone showroom available, so now  I buy it online from amazon, always there is risk of buying such costly thing online, but always amazon delivered original apple product to me,Now it‚Äôs near about 1 yrs from purchase of iPhone 12, there is no issue till date"
22,Apple iPhone 12 (128GB) - White,4,Worst for money
23,Apple iPhone 12 (128GB) - White,5,It‚Äôs a nice one under 50k (after discounts and exchange) as usual superb camera quality as its IOS and so do build quality. You need to activate esim from adhar based state and then can use it as secondary sim.
24,Apple iPhone 12 (128GB) - White,4,"The Best iphone i have used ,Camera is a beast, speakers are superb, display is unbelievable, and battery has never been better!But the touch response has been poor i am unable to type like i used to do on my iphone 7 or 8."
25,Apple iPhone 12 (128GB) - White,2,Minor dents on corners and scratches on main screen spending 80k to get this sucks. Dont recommend to buy especially from this seller.
26,Apple iPhone 12 (128GB) - White,1,"The product was getting overheated too soon while using apple apps like iMovie.Also got heated while chargingIf I have to buy an 80k phone and just make calls and messages... doesn't make sense..And Amazon would not replace it just like that they need a letter from Apple stating ""Service Denial"" so shuttling between Amazon and Apple after 2 days of purchase."
27,Apple iPhone 12 (128GB) - White,1,if u r selfi lover  i dont reccomend this
28,Apple iPhone 12 (128GB) - White,5,"Delivery boy ki aankhon mein viswas dikh jaata hai ki product real hai lelo bina khole ,so no open box delivery need‚Ä¶..phone is brilliant everything is fine‚Ä¶. Camera is blast‚Ä¶.. shifting from iPhone first time but not facing any issue."
29,Apple iPhone 12 (128GB) - White,4,"I used to use an Android phone till 2014 and wanted to switch to iOS, so the same year I bought iPhone 6, It was good to have an iOS device and the performance and the cameras but those were sufficient only until next year when 6s launched. Though I was a fan of the iPhone 5 and 5s box design but couldn't buy them somehow. I wasn't and I'm not crazy about changing or upgrading phone every year so in 2015 I bought again iPhone 6s by having a thought that this phone has everything which I needed ever, except for box design. Now I was satisfied enough with this.As time goes on and years passed away many iPhone models came but I wasn't eager to buy any of them but when this year series 12 launched, that made me excited to buy because firstly I was technologically behind and secondly the nostalgic box design.Years ago, when I switched to iOS, I'm quite satisfied with it, I never thought and want to go back to Android.When it comes to iPhone 12, it's a great and beautiful device. Smooth performance, good battery life, overpriced of course but people always have the choice to buy it or not. Though face ID is new to me and initially little inconvenient compared to touch ID, hopefully, I'm gonna used to of it.I bought a 128 GB device as per my requirement and colour white because finger prints on back are not visible, compared to other darker colours.INR 3000‚Çπ Discount on the colour white, plus 6000‚Çπ HDFC instant discount. Effective price 76000‚Çπ. Unfortunately Charging Brick isn't included and it coasted 1900‚Çπ more for 20W USB-C from Apple India website.Overall it's a great device and satisfied purchase but overpriced for sure."
30,Apple iPhone 12 (128GB) - White,2,"For some reason the phone is going blank suddenly, while using WhatsApp and other apps"
31,Apple iPhone 12 (128GB) - White,1,It‚Äôs used phone delivered to me
32,Apple iPhone 12 (128GB) - White,1,"In description it has iPhone 12 with 6.1 inch display, but actually received is iPhone 12 mini, it's total fraud with customers"
33,Apple iPhone 12 (128GB) - White,5,"While the iPhone 11 is an amazing device, without doubt, yet it has an IPS display. Older iPhone X and iPhone XS had OLED displays. Apple returned to OLED again with iPhone 12, although the refresh rate is at 60Hz. For those, who have not used devices with 90Hz or 120Hz, you would not notice any differences. Moving from an older iPhone with IPS display to iPhone 12, and you would immediately notice the crisp blacks. Battery size physically is less than the iPhone 11, yet Apple tweaks the A14 Bionic coupled with the iOS, which easily stretches the charge for 10-12hrs. on regular usage. Those heavily into web browsing, gaming etc. may not have such a long run with a single charge, yet it is capable enough for a pretty long day, without the need to plug in to the outlet. Oh, and yes, iPhone 12 comes with a USB-C to Lightning cable, but no charger. You will need to get a USB-C charger separately, either from Apple or other brands. Else, you can use your Qi charger, if you have one already.iPhone 12 also has a more boxy look, a throwback to the iconic iPhone 4 days. Overall, as with any Apple phone, it is an amazing device, if you use your smartphone for all the regular usage like apps, gaming, web browsing. And yes, it can send messages. Oh, forgot, it can make and receive calls too, quite well!"
34,Apple iPhone 12 (128GB) - White,4,"Pros- decent camera, display is amazing, phone is compact and handy.Cons- battery is not upto the mark, phone heats up when multitasking"
